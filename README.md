OutlookTools
============

Hi

Welcome to my first Git hub Contributions.

The name of my contribution is "OutlookTools".
This is a Powershell Module.

The idea behind this Module is, as a Powershell scripter, we spent 
most of our time on Powershell Console.

Sometime we have to create a new contact, new calendar invite, to that we have to open
Microsoft Outlook, sometime we were busy so we forget to do this task.

This happen a lot with me. So I decided to create a set of tools and module so that we can 
cerate new calendar meeting, contacts on the fly.

I just start writing it, but i will try to add more and more stuff in to it.

I hope you will like and share your contributions on this module, so that everyone can beniffited form this.

Thanking you in advance.

Thanks
